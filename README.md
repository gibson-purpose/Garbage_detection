# Garbage_detection
Manual garbage classification is time-consuming, prone to human error, and inconsistent in accuracy. With increasing waste generation, there is a need for automated and scalable systems to identify and categorize waste in real-time. Traditional image processing methods fail to generalize across varying waste types and environmental conditions. This research aims to build an intelligent garbage detection system using deep learning models to assist in effective waste management and environmental sustainability.

Objectives :

To develop a robust deep learning-based system that can accurately detect and classify garbage into predefined categories using image data. The project will compare the performance of EfficientNet, MobileNet, and YOLO architectures in terms of accuracy, speed, and efficiency. 
The final model will be suitable for integration with mobile applications, smart bins, or surveillance systems for real-time waste detection.
